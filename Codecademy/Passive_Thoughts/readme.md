# Passing Thoughts

<br><br>

> What if you could post something and know it wouldn’t live forever? In this project, we’ll build a place for our passing thoughts. Once you add a short thought, it’ll disappear after just 15 seconds.

> The ideas are supporting users to input their thought and click 'add' button to display a new list of their thought with 'remove' button
> If users click 'remove' button, a specific list of thought item will be removed
> If users don't click 'remove' button, any thought item appears below the input field will be removed after 15 seconds
