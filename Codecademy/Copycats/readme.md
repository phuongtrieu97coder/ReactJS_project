# Copycat

> In this project, weâ€™ll build a program that lets users type into a textbox and allows them to visualize the immediate effect that these changes have on the web page.

> Our program will display a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it. When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text will appear below the cat image, suggesting that the cat is being a copycat. Clicking on the image of the cat will toggle whether or not it is able to copy the user.

> Notice that when the cat is open the mouth, then users can see the result value that they have written inside the input field. 

> If the cat's mouth is taped, then users can't see any text value below the cat image

> When finish writing project, developer should see the title text 'Copy Cat ' + a different name instead of 'Copy Cat Tom'. This name depends on the props 'name' that developer insert to <CopyCat/> component
