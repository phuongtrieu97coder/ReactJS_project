# Copycat

> In this project, weâ€™ll build a program that lets users type into a textbox and allows them to visualize the immediate effect that these changes have on the web page.

> Our program will display a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it. When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text will appear below the cat image, suggesting that the cat is being a copycat. Clicking on the image of the cat will toggle whether or not it is able to copy the user.
