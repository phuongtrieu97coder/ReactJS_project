# Animal Fun Facts

> In this project, we’ll build a program that allows users to click an animal on the screen in order to have a fun fact pop up.

> Our program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not.
> Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen.
> As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
